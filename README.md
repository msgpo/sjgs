1) *What is SJGS and why should I use it?*

> SJGS is meant to provide all the functionality that any starting 2D
 developer would need for creating games, while remaining as simple and
 easy-to-use as possible. SJGS offers customizeable levels of
 configuration for almost all elements in the engine to cater to
 beginners and advanced users alike. This gives SJGS a much smaller
 learning curve compared to more complex game engines on the market.
 SJGS is also more than just a physics engine, implementing everything
from media loading and management, physics, input, game loops, window
 systems, tile map support, world handling, multiple language support,
 and much much more. So what are you waiting for? Try SJGS today!

2) *What are its components and dependencies?*

> SJGS is written in both Java and Jython, which means it will require the standalone Jython .jar to function. For sound, SJGS uses JLayer to play .mp3 files, so JLayer is a requirement as well. The JLayer .jar packaged with SJGS is special however, as it is **modified to accept sound gain, pausing, and stopping** where the official JLayer does not. You will need to include both of these .jars along with SJGS's .jar in your project's build path in order to use SJGS.

3) *What are its licenses?*

> SJGS and its dependencies are proudly **open-source**!

> **SJGS** is licensed under [**LGPL 3.0**](https://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0)

> **JLayer** is licensed under [**LGPL 3.0**](https://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0)

> **Jython** is licensed under its [**own license**](http://www.jython.org/license.html)

3.1) *I don't know what those mean, can I use it for my commercial project?*

> Yes! As this license is fully open-source, you have free-will to use SJGS in your commercial project. 
> However, if your project were to be a derivative of SJGS, (and not just using it), you then must have your 
> project licensed under LGPL 3.0 as well. Some sort of recognition for the engine used for your game 
> would be much appreciated as well ;)

4) *How should I use it?*

> There are essentially two ways to use SJGS. Either in pieces included in your source code, or built into a .jar 
> which is then added to your project's build path. The second way is much, much simpler. You will find a .jar 
> of the final built project in the 'build' folder above. I suggest using an IDE such as Eclipse to handle this for you.

5) *Where can I get tutorials or documentation for SJGS?*

> TBA --- video tutorials are pending

6) *How can I contribute to SJGS?*
